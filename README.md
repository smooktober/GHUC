# GitHubUserCheck (GHUC)
GHUC is a JS Console script which finds and optionally applies available usernames to your account. Being written entirely in JS, it voids the need for users to know how to run it locally, and allows for the absence of proxies, as requests are not being made to change your username but to find if one is available, all while being relatively speedy. Find your dream username today!
## Parameters
GHUC will ask for 4 main parameters:
- Mode (List or AutoChange)
- Length of Username (1 - 34)
- Amount of Usernames to check (1 - ∞)
- Delay between requests (1ms - ∞ms)
